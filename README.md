## 👋 About Me

I’m a frontend-focused full stack developer with 4+ years of professional experience working on enterprise-grade applications in fintech, banking, and edtech. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and pixel-perfect user interfaces using React, Next.js, Vue, and backend services in Java and Node.js.

This repo showcases real-world projects I've delivered across my professional roles — from banking system modernization at Bank Al Habib, to building Easypaisa's Digital Bank onboarding systems.
